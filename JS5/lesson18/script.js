// Backend, callbacks, Promises and Async Await

// Backend is another computer that manages the data of a website

// HypertText Transfer Protocol

// GET  -> get some information from the backend
/* Type of requests
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
*/

/* The backend can respod with diffrent types of data */

// URL - uniform resouce locator
// URL Paths-> Each URL paths wil  give us a diffrent response

// Status code - starts with 4 or 5 (400,404,500)=failed
// 4- our problem     5-backend's problem
// starts with 2(200,201,204)=succeeded

// function without a name is anonymous function

// Promises - better way to handle asynchronus code
// similar to done() function
// let us wait for some code to finish , before going to the next step

/* resolve is a function 
-similar to done() function
-lets us control when to go to the next step
-allows javascript to do multiple things at the same time*/
